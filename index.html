                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Health:</strong> Exposure to toxic pesticides in agriculture, extreme heat, heavy lifting leading to spinal damage, and high rates of industrial accidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Long-term trauma, severe stress, anxiety, and depression resulting from exploitation, isolation, and violence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Approximately **73 million children** work in hazardous conditions, which is one of the worst forms of child labor (ILO/UNICEF).</li>

                    <li><strong>Development:</strong> Child labor inhibits a country's economic growth by creating an unskilled, low-wage adult workforce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Goal:</strong> Sustainable Development Goal **Target 8.7** aims to end child labor in all its forms by 2025. Progress has slowed significantly.</li>

                <h3>THEN (Industrial Revolution Era)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Industry Focus:</strong> Primarily **Textiles, Mining, and Factories**. Work was often indoors in urban, industrial settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working Hours:</strong> Routinely **12 to 14 hours per day**, 6 days a week, often with mandatory overtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Context:</strong> Few or no laws restricting minimum age or hazardous work. Laws were state-specific and often ignored.</li>
                    <li><strong>Worst Forms:</strong> High rates of accidents, lung diseases (dust inhalation), and physical deformities due to long hours and poor posture.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Industry Focus:</strong> Primarily **Agriculture (70%)** and **Services**. Work is often outdoors, in remote rural areas, or supply chains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working Hours:</strong> Restricted by ILO conventions, but often exceeds 8 hours a day, especially in informal sectors. Hidden work makes enforcement difficult.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Context:</strong> Globally regulated by ILO Conventions C138 (Minimum Age) and C182 (Worst Forms), but enforcement is weak in poverty-stricken regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Worst Forms:</strong> Hazardous work in mining, sexual exploitation, trafficking, and forced labor, often tied to global supply chains.</li>

                <h3>The Poverty-Labor Trap</h3>
                <p>The **Incidents by Poverty Level** chart directly illustrates a core driver of child labor: economic necessity. Regions classified as 'High Poverty' often show the highest absolute numbers of incidents.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rural Concentration:</strong> Because child labor is dominated by **Agriculture**, this issue is concentrated in rural areas where families rely on child inputs for subsistence farming or small cash crops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informal Economy:</strong> In low GDP countries, labor laws are often ineffective in the vast informal sectors, where children are easily exploited and hidden from inspectors.</li>

                <h3>Our Role in the Global Supply Chain</h3>
                <p>The connection between your local supermarket and global child labor is the **Supply Chain**. This is where demand from high-GDP countries drives exploitation in low-GDP nations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Products:</strong> Common products linked to child labor include cocoa (chocolate), cotton (clothing), coffee, tobacco, and mining minerals (electronics).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> The complexity of modern supply chains allows companies to deny responsibility, making it difficult for consumers to track the origin of goods.</li>

        <h2>🤝 Taking Action: What Can Consumers Do?</h2>
        <p>Data awareness is the first step. Here are practical ways you can help reduce the global demand for child labor:</p>
        
        <div class="action-points">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Look for Certification:</strong> Purchase products with certifications like **Fair Trade**, Rainforest Alliance, or RugMark, which guarantee labor standards and audit their supply chains.</li>
                <li><strong>Demand Transparency:</strong> Use your voice (online reviews, social media) to ask brands, especially clothing and electronics companies, about the specific origin and labor conditions of their materials.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support Education:</strong> Donate to or support NGOs (like UNICEF and local charities) that focus on providing education, vocational training, and family income support in high-risk areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Educate Others:</strong> Share the data and resources from this dashboard with friends, family, and social networks to raise collective awareness about supply chain issues.</li>
